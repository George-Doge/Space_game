# SPACE GAME MINER

Welcome to my Space Miner game. Right now you can mine two types of asteroids (common, and rare) and sell them.
Their rate of dropping 'cargo' is randomized every time they are mined. Station prices are randomized every time you start the code.
Minigame also supports the save and load system. I may add something in the future. You can modify some variables in the code if you want to.
Check [credits.md](credits.md) for sources. Code in development branch is newer than the main branch, so you can check it out too.

## VERSION 0.2.3
- [x] MINING & SELLING
- [x] SAVE & LOAD
- [X] MORE ASTEROID TYPES
- [ ] UPDATED START/PAUSE MENU
- [ ] CLEAN UP THE CODE
- [ ] ADDITIONAL THINGS??

### NOTES
Currently I am working on improved main menu and pause menu, so things will be messy. After that I plan to somehow 
clean up the code, because it is getting harder to navigate in it.
