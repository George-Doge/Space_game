# SPACE GAME MINER

Welcome to my Space Miner game. Right now you can mine two types of asteroids (common, and rare) and sell them.
Their rate of dropping 'cargo' is randomized every time they are mined. Station prices are randomized every time you start the code.
Minigame also supports the save and load system. I may add something in the future. You can modify some variables in the code if you want to.
Check [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for sources. The code in the development branch is newer than the main branch so you can check it out too.

Running this game in the default window size (1080x864) or in fullscreen is recommended!
